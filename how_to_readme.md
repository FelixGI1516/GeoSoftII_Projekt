## A short guide to README writing

1. Use provided template => uniformity and comparability (add yes; shorten no)
2. Please enrich with images and illustrations where possible.
3. Images are created in the top level folder `images` [example](https://github.com/FelixGI1516/GeoSoftII_SST_Process)
3. Link everything that is possible
3. In places where something is still incomplete or in progress, please mark with :warning:, :construction:, :bangbang: etc.
